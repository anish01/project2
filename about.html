        I am Anish Chakrabarti, a senior, majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Systems Engineering at Washington University, St. Louis. Before coming to Washington University, I graduated from Drury University in Springfield, MO with a Physics and Math major, and Business and Global studies.
        <br>
        <br>
        I just finished a summer internship at a silicon-valley startup called Udacity in Mountain View, CA. At Udacity I was a course manager and software developer. While at Udacity, I took numerous courses, learning Python, web-development, object-oriented programming and data science. I was in-charge is supporting these courses to our world-wide student base, and hence had to talk to a lot of our customers, often face to face. I also had a great chance to work in a start-up atmosphere, and understand the pace and culture in such a work atmosphere. I absolutely loved it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Last summer-fall (2013) I did a Co-Op at Hunter Engineering, in Bridgeton, MO. As a part of my responsibilities I am regularly involved in programming and designing various systems. As a part of a seven month Co-Op I have had experience with Linux and have completed a project on updating server libraries, in which I had to work extensively with Linux and Make. Another project I worked on involved programming in C++, manipulating 3D scenes using OpenSceneGraph libraries, and making excel macros for analyzing log files sent in by customers. My final project involved me developing an analysis app using C++ and html.
        <br>
        <br>
        At Washington University I was involved in a research project on modeling and designing a system where we can move a remote controlled car according to our brain impulses. While working on these projects I learnt many computer-programming languages such as JAVA, LABVIEW, MATLAB and C++. 
        <br>
        <br>
        During my years at Drury University, I was heavily involved in Physics research with Dr. G.Ojakangas. In this research we built from scratch a 2-degree of freedom model of a human arm using everyday material. This mechanical arm was different from other arms due to its use of elastic tubing to model muscles. The elastic tubing made the muscles nonlinear, which makes programming and modeling the arm significantly more challenging. Our project was selected for NASA's Zero Gravity airplane in summer 2012. I have presented my research and findings in numerous national conferences.
        <br>
        <br>
        Apart from academic work, I was elected as the Senior Class President for the graduating class of 2012 at Drury University. I was also the Vice President of the Student Government Association during my junior year and I was selected as the President of my universities chapter of Society of Physics for two years. My academic achievements include, outstanding Physics student award for the graduating class. I was part of the Deanâ€™s list for all four years.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was also selected as one of the 10 undergrads in 2011 for a national internship position at the American Institute of Physics, College Park, MD. During my internship I was responsible for developing a model of science cafes for students across the country.
